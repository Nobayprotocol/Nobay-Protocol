# $NOBAY Tokenomics

**$NOBAY** begins as a meme — but evolves into protocol infrastructure.  
This document outlines the token’s origin, planned utility, and long-term role in the Nobay Protocol.

## Phase 0: Pump.fun Launch

$NOBAY originates as a community token launched via [Pump.fun](https://pump.fun).  
This launch serves three purposes:

- **Fundraising**: Provides early liquidity for future development
- **Awareness**: Onboards meme traders into the Nobay ecosystem
- **Experimentation**: Tests how far narrative + protocol can blend

No promises. Just a meme — for now.

## Phase 1: Protocol Utility

As the protocol evolves, $NOBAY will gain **real functionality** within the Nobay ecosystem:

### 1. **Stake for Trust Tiers**
- Sellers stake $NOBAY to access visibility boosts
- Higher tiers = more exposure, faster indexing, badge indicators
- Stake is slashed for failure or fraud

### 2. **DAO Voting**
- Token holders vote on protocol upgrades, slashing ratios, emissions, and grants
- Phase 1 governance = multisig
- Phase 2+ governance = token-weighted DAO

### 3. **Listing Boosts**
- Optional: sellers spend $NOBAY to push listings to discovery feeds
- Similar to "promoted" items, but on neutral protocol terms

## Supply Structure

Current plan (subject to DAO vote):

- **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 $NOBAY (fixed)
- **Pump.fun Launch:** 100% released via initial meme phase
- **Future Allocations:**  
  - DAO Treasury: 20% buyback from market or community reallocation  
  - Contributor Rewards: through on-chain proposals only  
  - Protocol grants: no pre-mines or hidden wallets

---

## Emissions Policy

There is **no inflation** by default.  
Future emissions must be voted on by DAO. This keeps the token deflationary unless the community explicitly expands it.

## Philosophical Notes

> $NOBAY is not just a meme or a governance token.  
> It’s the **key to listing, staking, upgrading, and governing** a new class of sovereign marketplaces.

This isn’t about replacing eBay — it’s about deleting the need for one.

## Disclaimers

- This is a living document.
- $NOBAY does not guarantee returns or protocol rights until utility is activated.
- Always do your own research and understand that meme coins carry risk.

Build memes. Govern infrastructure.  
That’s the Nobay way.
