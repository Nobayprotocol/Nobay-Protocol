# Nobay Governance

The Nobay Protocol is designed to evolve from **founder-led governance** into a fully **token-governed DAO**. This document outlines the governance architecture across all phases.

---

## Phase 1 – Multisig Control (Initial Deployment)

At launch, key protocol parameters will be controlled by a 3-of-5 multisig held by core contributors.

This includes:
- Emergency pause functions  
- Upgrades to ListingRegistry and StakingModule  
- Treasury wallet management  
- Grant allocations and reward bounties

This phase allows for flexible iteration while infrastructure is tested and community coordination builds.

---

## Phase 2 – DAO Transition

Once the protocol reaches its first stable release, governance powers will transition to the DAO.

### **DAO Framework**
- Snapshot-based off-chain voting for proposals
- On-chain execution via a Timelock Governor contract
- Votes weighted by staked $NOBAY tokens

**Stakers = Voters.**  
Only active participants shape the protocol.

---

## What the DAO Will Control

- Listing module upgrades  
- Dispute resolution plugin approval  
- Reputation scoring algorithm  
- Treasury disbursement for grants, audits, and forks  
- Emissions policy (if inflation is reintroduced)  
- Tier thresholds and staking cooldowns

---

## Proposal Lifecycle

1. **Proposal Submission** – Anyone can draft and submit a proposal using standard templates
2. **Snapshot Vote** – $NOBAY stakers vote off-chain
3. **Quorum Threshold** – If quorum met, proposal passes
4. **Execution Delay** – 48–72h Timelock allows review
5. **On-Chain Action** – Smart contract executes upgrade or transfer

---

## Emergency Governance

During early growth, the multisig retains veto power and emergency override rights for protocol safety. These will be phased out or made transparent via on-chain vote.

---

## Fork Sovereignty

Nobay encourages forks.

Communities may fork:
- The interface  
- The contract stack  
- The governance framework  

Each fork may launch its own $NOBAY-derived token or retain compatibility with the parent DAO.

> Nobay is a protocol, not a platform.  
> Governance isn’t permission — it’s participation.

---

## Looking Ahead

- DAO dashboard to go live in Phase 2  
- GitHub Issues will host proposal drafts and discussion  
- Grant applications and contributor roles will be voted on quarterly

DAO contributors are the builders, not the audience.  
If you hold $NOBAY, you govern.
