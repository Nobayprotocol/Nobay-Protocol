# Security Policy

Thanks for helping keep Nobay Protocol safe and open.

This document outlines how to responsibly report security issues or smart contract vulnerabilities.

---

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a critical bug or exploit affecting:

- Smart contracts in `/contracts/`  
- DAO configuration or multisig logic  
- Tokenomics mechanics or staking logic  
- Governance systems or dispute modules

Please report it privately via email:

**isabel@isabelfrasier.com**  

---

## Responsible Disclosure

We ask that you:
- Do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities before they are patched  
- Avoid exploiting bugs to drain value or manipulate governance  
- Include as much technical detail and repro instructions as possible  
- Allow us reasonable time to verify and respond

---

## Rewards

We are not currently running a formal bug bounty. However:
- All verified critical security reports will be acknowledged publicly (if desired)  
- DAO may vote to retroactively reward ethical disclosures in $NOBAY

---

## Scope

Currently in-scope contracts:
- `ListingRegistry.sol`  
- `StakingModule.sol`  
- `Escrow.sol`

## Thank You

We deeply appreciate your help in keeping Nobay open, safe, and forkable. Security researchers are builders, too.
